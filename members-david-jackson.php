        <p><em>So Blue, So Beautiful</em> documents an encounter with my father and his house in Malta after the fact of my motherâ€™s death. After she died I knew I would have to photograph him. At the time I had no plan, no precise idea what this would mean, only the certainty of an obligation which began to impose itself on me. At the heart of this familial exchange between father and son lie the immediacies of the Mediterranean not only as a place of lived, everyday experience but also as a projected space of home and belonging. My project is both visual record and emotional inventory: an autoethnography in pictures, if you like.</p>
