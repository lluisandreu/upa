			<h2>About Us</h2>
			
			<p>Welcome to The Urban Photographers Association, the website designed to share work

of contemporary international photographers focusing on cities and the 

urban realm. The photographers and artists shown on the membersâ€™ 

gallery represent a diverse range of practices including landscape, 

architectural, portraiture, fine art, documentary, street-based and object 

photography; all informed by an active engagement with urban theory 

and associated research methods.</p> 
			
			<p>The projects reflect the experiences of personal, often immersive 

involvement in the urban spaces the image-makers have chosen to work 

within, and they also raise questions about how photography might speak 

to debates within urban ethnography and visual arts practice in ways that 

are culturally, sociologically, historically and aesthetically meaningful 

for an increasingly wide audience interested in the visual representation, 

evocation and poetics of everyday city life.</p>
			
			<p>The association has a number of forthcoming events including 

exhibitions, seminars and workshops, and members are actively involved 

in publishing and expanding the field of urban photography and visual 

urbanism through projects, partnerships and collaborations with both 

local and international institutions.</p>

			<p>The site is supported by Urban Photo Fest, an international photographic 

festival exploring urban visual practices.</p>
