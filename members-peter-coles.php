        <p>After finishing a doctorate in psychology at Oxford University, Peter Coles moved to Paris where he worked as a journalist and photographer for 20 years, completing a major body of work called <i>Paris Traces</i> on abandoned objects, which has been exhibited in Paris and Rome and has featured in magazines, including <em>The Independent on Sunday</em>. He now lives in London as a writer, editor and fine art photographer and is working on a book on ancient urban trees. Since 2007 Peter has been a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Urban and Community Research, Goldsmiths, University of London, where he teaches on the M.A. in Photography and Urban Cultures.</p>

		<p>This series is part of a larger work called <em>Paris Traces</em> on anonymous communication between people through objects left on the streets. Paris has few charity shops, so Parisians sometimes leave their unwanted shoes out for a passer-by to take. They are usually placed neatly in a prominent place and seldom stay there for long. I never rearrange the shoes and only photograph pairs that seem to have have been left deliberately. I started the project in the mid-1990s and, as it depends entirely on chance discoveries, I use whichever camera I have with me at the time.</p>
