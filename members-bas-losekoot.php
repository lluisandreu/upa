		<p>Since the beginning of the Urban Millennium, humankind is facing the 
biggest wave of urbanisation in human history. In 2011 Losekoot started a worldwide visual exploration on the effects of growing population density 
on citizens inhabiting eight crowded megacities, entitled, ‘The Urban Millennium Project.’ George Simmel wrote, “One nowhere feels as lonely and lost as in the metropolitan crowd.” Thus, the anonymity of the human in the crowd is an important part of the metropolitan experience and Losekoot’s project. Excessive social growth affects a sense of personal space in an expanding public realm. There are unwritten social rules that provide each person with individual space and freedom, as long as others are left alone in personal space. Within certain boundaries, it is allowed to look at something in public that is actually private. Humankind observes the stranger in public areas of the city, when alone in the crowd and ‘in company of strangers.’</p>
